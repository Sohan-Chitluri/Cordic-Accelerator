# CORDIC Timing-Closure Results — Flow v0 → v1

All runs: Sky130 HD (`sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80`), OpenROAD 26Q2, Yosys
0.69+post, standalone OpenSTA 3.1.0 (`tools/OpenSTA/build/sta`), clock
11.5 ns unless noted. Post-route numbers are always from the standalone
OpenSTA run against the real extracted SPEF (`scripts/sta_postroute.tcl`),
never OpenROAD's own inline resident-timer report — see that script's
header comment for why the two are not interchangeable. Regression =
`make test-unit` (11/11 unit+integration tests).

| Step | Change | Regression | WNS (max) | TNS (max) | WHS (min) | Post-route cells | Area (um²) / util |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Flow v0 | baseline `pr.tcl` (unchanged since commit `dfa2b01`) | 11/11 | -24.18 ns | -1885.86 ns | +0.32 ns | (not counted) | 55192 / 43% |
| Flow v1 step 1 | + `set_wire_rc -signal -layer met2` / `-clock -layer met3` before global placement | 11/11 | -24.18 ns (unchanged) | -1885.86 ns (unchanged) | +0.32 ns | 18515 | 55192 / 43% |

**Step 1 finding:** giving global placement a wire-RC estimate made **no
measurable difference** to real post-route timing, even though OpenROAD's
own internal (non-SPEF) resident timer swung from `worst slack max +0.23 /
tns 0.00` (Flow v0) to `worst slack max -4.48 / tns -186.80` once it had an
RC estimate to place against. Placement alone can't fix this path: the
dominant 18.1 ns hop (Step 1 diagnosis, see chat) is a minimum-drive
`nor4b_1` gate driving ~50 unbuffered fanout pins — that's a drive-strength/
buffering problem, not a wire-topology problem, and no placement-only pass
touches gate sizing. Confirms `repair_design` (or `-timing_driven` placement,
which includes resizing) is the next candidate, not further RC tuning.
